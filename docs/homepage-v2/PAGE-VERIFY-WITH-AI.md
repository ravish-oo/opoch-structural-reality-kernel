# VERIFY WITH YOUR OWN AI - FULL SPEC

---

## PART 1: HOME PAGE INTEGRATION

### Where to Add Link (In Screenshot's "Verified by" Section)

**Current structure:**
```
VERIFIED BY
[GPT-5 ↗] [Claude ↗] [Grok ↗] [DeepSeek ↗]
Independent confirmation via public chats
```

**Add below:**
```
VERIFIED BY
[GPT-5 ↗] [Claude ↗] [Grok ↗] [DeepSeek ↗]
Independent confirmation via public chats

Verify yourself with your own AI →
```

**Or alternative (inline):**
```
VERIFIED BY
[GPT-5 ↗] [Claude ↗] [Grok ↗] [DeepSeek ↗]
Independent confirmation via public chats | Verify yourself →
```

**Style:**
- "Verify yourself" = small text link (14px)
- Color: white/60, hover: white
- Arrow icon (→)
- Links to /verify-independently page

---

## PART 2: STARTER PROMPT (IMPROVED)

**Current:** 
"If someone has theory of everything, what all should it have such that it completely proves that they have theory of everything and no need of peer review, give the complete list"

**Problems:**
- Awkward grammar
- Defensive tone ("no need of peer review")
- Not conversational

**Improved version:**

```
What would a complete Theory of Everything need to demonstrate? 
Give me the full criteria—from fundamental axioms to testable 
predictions—that would constitute actual proof.
```

**Why better:**
- Natural, conversational
- No defensive language
- Open-ended (invites thorough answer)
- "Actual proof" challenges AI to be rigorous

**Alternative (more direct):**

```
If someone claims to have a Theory of Everything, what evidence 
would you need to see before accepting it as valid? List the 
complete requirements.
```

## PART 3: PAGE CONTENT

### PAGE HEADER

Don't trust our verification? Test the theory yourself—
in your own ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok account.

### SECTION 1: WHY VERIFY INDEPENDENTLY

```
## Why Verify This Way?

You might think our AI verification links are cherry-picked, 
prompt-engineered, or use a hidden vector store. Valid skepticism.

So verify it yourself:
• Use YOUR AI account (not ours)
• No context from us (start fresh)
• Compare answers independently
• See if your AI reaches the same conclusions

If the theory holds, your AI will confirm it. If it doesn't, 
you'll break it.
```

### SECTION 2: THE PROCESS (Visual Steps)

```
## How It Works

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Ask Your AI                             │
│  Start with a general question about        │
│  what TOE should prove                      │
│                                             │
│  [Copy starter prompt ↓]                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  2. Get Requirements                        │
│  Your AI will list what TOE must prove      │
│  (quantum gravity, consciousness, etc.)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  3. Ask Opoch's GPT-5                       │
│  Paste the same question in our chat        │
│  See what our TOE-verified GPT-5 says       │
│                                             │
│  [Start chatting →]                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  4. Cross-Verify                            │
│  Copy our GPT-5's answer                    │
│  Paste it back to your AI                   │
│  Ask: "Does this answer satisfy             │
│  the requirements?"                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  5. Repeat Until Satisfied                  │
│  Keep going back and forth                  │
│  Either: Your AI confirms                   │
│     Or: You find a contradiction            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### SECTION 3: STARTER PROMPT (Copyable)

```
## 1. Starter Prompt for Your AI

Copy this and paste into your ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What would a complete Theory of Everything  │
│ need to demonstrate? Give me the full       │
│ criteria—from fundamental axioms to         │
│ testable predictions—that would constitute  │
│ actual proof.                               │
│                                             │
│ [Copy to clipboard 📋]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Copy button (one-click copy)
- Prominent box (stands out)
- Clear, improved wording

### SECTION 4: DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS

```
## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Your AI
Open ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, or your preferred AI in a new tab.
Start a fresh conversation (no prior context).

### Step 2: Ask the General Question
Paste the starter prompt above, or ask your own version.
Your AI will list requirements: quantum gravity, consciousness, 
P vs NP, etc.

### Step 3: Go to Opoch Chat
Click below to open our GPT-5 chat interface:
[Start chatting with GPT-5 →]

Paste the SAME question. See what our TOE-verified GPT-5 responds.

### Step 4: Cross-Check
Copy our GPT-5's response.
Go back to your AI.
Paste it and ask:

"Here's a proposed answer. Does this satisfy all the 
requirements you listed? Point out any gaps or contradictions."

### Step 5: Iterate
Keep going back and forth:
- Your AI raises objections → ask our GPT-5
- Our GPT-5 responds → verify with your AI
- Repeat until one of two outcomes:

✓ Your AI confirms the theory holds
✗ You find an unresolvable contradiction

If you find a contradiction, submit it to our Falsify page.
```

### SECTION 5: WHAT YOU'RE TESTING

```
## What You're Actually Verifying

When you do this process, you're testing:

1. **Completeness**: Does TOE address all known frontiers?
2. **Consistency**: Do answers match across independent AIs?
3. **Rigor**: Can it withstand adversarial questioning?
4. **Independence**: Does our GPT-5 give the same answers 
   without prompt engineering or hidden context?

If all four hold after 5-10 rounds of cross-checking, 
the theory is robust. If any breaks, you've falsified it.
```

---

### SECTION 6: EXPECTED OUTCOMES

```
## What to Expect

### If the Theory Holds:
Your AI will progressively confirm:
- All major problems are addressed
- Answers are consistent with physics/math
- No circular reasoning or hand-waving
- Solutions match what other AIs verified

### If You Break It:
You'll find:
- A requirement TOE doesn't meet
- Contradictory answers between AIs
- Logical gaps your AI can't reconcile
- Submit to: opoch.com/falsify

Either way, you've verified independently.
```

---

### SECTION 7: FAQS (Optional Expandable)

```
## Common Questions

▼ Why not just read the paper?
The paper is technical. This process lets you test claims 
interactively, in plain language, with your own AI doing 
the fact-checking.

▼ Can I use a different starting prompt?
Yes! The starter is just a suggestion. Ask whatever you 
think a TOE should prove.

▼ How long does this take?
5-15 minutes if you're thorough. Depends on how deep you dig.

▼ What if my AI gives different answers than yours?
That's the point! If they genuinely contradict (not just 
phrasing differences), you may have found a falsification.

▼ Do I need to understand the math?
No. Your AI translates technical claims into plain language. 
You're testing consistency, not doing proofs yourself.

✓ Neutral outcomes (confirm OR break—both valid)  
✓ Respect user's independence (your AI, your terms)

**Avoid:**
✗ "You'll see we're right"  
✗ "Our verification is perfect"  
✗ Defensive language about prompt engineering

**Voice:**
- Matter-of-fact
- Inviting challenge
- Confident but not arrogant
