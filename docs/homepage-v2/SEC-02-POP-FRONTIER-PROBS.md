  ## FULL CARD CONTENT

  ### Card 1: Consciousness
  **Problem:** Consciousness  
  **Context:** The hard problem  
  **Solution:** Reflexive confluence—observer = observed when free↔paid loops have zero holonomy. Conscious updating = natural gradient in Fisher/Hessian metric.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 2: Quantum Gravity
  **Problem:** Quantum gravity  
  **Context:** Unifying QM and GR  
  **Solution:** Free sector = exact Kähler (unitary). GR from diffeo symmetry + FY balance. Orthogonal split: free vs paid on same cloth.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 3: Black Hole Information Paradox
  **Problem:** Black hole information paradox  
  **Solution:** Horizons are FY/Green faces. Unitary flux + paid boundary writes conserve truth exactly. No hidden minting, no loss.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 4: Quantum Measurement
  **Problem:** Quantum measurement & nonlocality  
  **Context:** Born rule, collapse, entanglement  
  **Solution:** Measurement = local FY-tight paid update. Entanglement = lawful gluing. Born weights are unique SCFA measure. Zero FTL.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 5: Why Math Works
  **Problem:** Why mathematics describes nature  
  **Solution:** Π/FY/GLUE force the grammar: closures give logic, counting writes gives ℕ, completion gives ℝ, quarter-turn gives ℂ. Calculus = FY + Stokes.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 6: Dark Matter/Energy
  **Problem:** Dark matter / dark energy  
  **Context:** Cosmological "constants"  
  **Solution:** Ledger/face terms from coarse interfaces and symmetry choices. Not new particles. T_ab is FY-derived. "Dark" labels are bookkeeping gaps.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 7: Arrow of Time
  **Problem:** Arrow of time & Second Law  
  **Solution:** Time = bits paid. Ledger equalities E_min = kT ln2 ΔN, P = -kT dD/dt make irreversibility the price of exact writes.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 8: Spacetime
  **Problem:** Spacetime & speed of light  
  **Solution:** Free finite-speed isometries force Minkowski interval. c is invariant slope of free moves. Noether currents are conserved free flows.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 9: Mass & Gauge
  **Problem:** Origin of mass, inertia & gauge  
  **Context:** Mass gap problem  
  **Solution:** Gauge = free isometries. Mass = curvature (paid stiffness) of potential. Gaps are minimal paid energy to sustain nontrivial holonomy.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 10: Constants
  **Problem:** Constants of nature  
  **Context:** Why α, etc.  
  **Solution:** Forms of laws fixed by grammar. Numbers are measured boundary bills with dependencies. Many collapse to fewer independent invoices.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 11: Life & Evolution
  **Problem:** Life, evolution, purpose vs entropy  
  **Solution:** Living processes run free symmetries while spending fewest bits to hold low divergence. Selection = minimizing long-run paid cost under constraints.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ### Card 12: Universal Intelligence
  **Problem:** Universal intelligence / AGI  
  **Context:** Semantics, proof-carrying answers  
  **Solution:** Universal Answer Compiler: Present (Π) → Free whitening → FY-tight solve. Language = SCFA copy/merge of truths.  
  **Link:** Verify ↗

  ## EXPAND BEHAVIOR

  **Initial state:** 6 cards visible

  **Button:** "View all 12 problems →"

  **After click:** 
  - Remaining 6 cards appear
  - Button disappears OR changes to "Collapse ↑"

  ---

  ## AFTER CARDS ELEMENT

  **Simple text (optional):**
  ```
  Each solution verified independently. Test any claim.
  ```

  **OR just transition to next section** (Impact/Next Frontiers)

  ---

  ## MOBILE BEHAVIOR

  - Cards stack vertically (1 column)
  - Solution text might be truncated with "Read more"
  - Verify link always visible

  ---

  ## DESIGN REFERENCES

  **Similar to:** Moonshots page card layout (opoch.com/moonshots)

  **Key differences:**
  - No "Submit" buttons (not challenges)
  - "Verify" links instead
  - Simpler cards (problem + solution + link)
  - No filtering/tags needed

  ---

  ## MENTAL STATE MANAGEMENT

  **User arrives thinking:**
  "Okay, TOE claim. Show me what you actually solved."

  **After scanning cards:**
  - Recognizes problems (consciousness, quantum gravity)
  - Sees technical solutions (not hand-waving)
  - Verify links available (can check)
  - Thinks: "If this is real, I need to test it"

  **Conversion trigger:**
  - By card 3-4, excitement builds
  - Clicks "Test It Yourself" (hero CTA) OR
  - Continues to Impact section → then clicks

  ---

  ## HIERARCHY (most to least important)

  1. Problem names (recognition)
  2. Solutions (substance)
  3. Verify links (trust)
  4. Context labels (optional clarity)
