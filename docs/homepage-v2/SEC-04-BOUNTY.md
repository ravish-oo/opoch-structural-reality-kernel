## WHY THIS WORKS FOR YOUR AUDIENCE

**VCs/Founders:**
- Real money = serious credibility
- Clear ROI if TOE works
- Tangible business opportunities

**Researchers:**
- Famous problems they know
- "TOE approach" hints show it's not hand-waving
- Direct path to contribution

**Skeptics:**
- "Put your money where your mouth is" proof
- Can verify bounties are real (external links)
- Shows confidence (TOE enables these)

**Believers:**
- Clear next action (chat about specific problem)
- Starter code = low friction
- Community contribution opportunity

---

## DESIGN CONSISTENCY

**Matches:**
- Impact section cards (similar layout)
- Frontiers cards (problem + solution format)
- Hero verification strip (credibility signals)

**Differentiators:**
- Prize money most prominent (not outcome)
- External links (not internal verify)
- Action-oriented CTAs (participation, not just learning)
