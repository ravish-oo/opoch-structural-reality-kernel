# HOME PAGE - HIGH LEVEL STRUCTURE

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Deep tech founders, VCs, researchers, mathematicians, physicists, advanced engineers

**Psychographic Profile**:
- High IQ, technically literate
- Familiar with frontier problems (P vs NP, quantum gravity, consciousness)
- Skeptical by nature
- Hit known walls in their domains
- Value verification and proof over claims
- Will give 15-30 seconds if convinced there's substance

**User Segments**:
1. **Willing-to-try skeptics** (60%) - most common, will test if convinced
2. **Neutral curious** (30%) - open-minded, looking for signal
3. **Positive believers** (10%) - already interested in TOE

**Key Mental Models We're Addressing**:
- "This is probably AI slop/hallucination"
- "They probably prompt-engineered it"
- "Every TOE claim has failed before"
- "How is this different from string theory?"
- "I need to verify this myself"

---

## Strategic Approach

**Core Principle**: Meet users where they are, collapse doubts immediately

**What This Means**:
- Use known boundaries they've already hit (zero cognitive load)
- Show objective comparisons to existing theories
- Provide immediate verification paths
- Let them test in their own territory
- No defensive marketing speak
- Put control in their hands

**Conversion Funnel**:
1. Land → see bold claim
2. Test it yourself (primary CTA)
3. See how it compares to other theories (objective proof)
4. Verify independently (your own AI)
5. Apply it (bounties - real money)
6. See ongoing validation (falsify record)
7. Understand implications (impact, future)

## Page Structure Overview

### SECTION 1: HERO
**Purpose**: State claim, provide immediate action, show verification  
**Key Elements**:
- H1: TOE is here
- Subhead: Physics, math, consciousness solved
- Primary CTA: Test It Yourself
- AI verification strip (GPT-5, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek)
- Engine status (WIP disclosure)
- Secondary CTA: Falsify Us

**Conversion Goal**: Get user to click "Test It Yourself"

**Status**: ✅ Spec complete

---

### SECTION 2: COMPARISON TABLE
**Purpose**: Break skepticism by showing objective superiority over existing TOE attempts  
**Key Elements**:
- Section title: "Where Every Theory Stopped—Until Now"
- Table comparing String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, Others, Ω
- 7-12 frontier problems as rows (Quantum Gravity, Consciousness, P vs NP, etc.)
- Each Ω cell has solution summary + [Verify ↗] link to public chat
- Below table: "Each solution independently verified by AI"

**Why This Works**:
- Shows why others failed (validates walls are real)
- Shows Ω solves them (with proof links)
- Objective comparison (not defensive claims)
- User picks their domain and verifies

**Conversion Goal**: Move skeptic from "probably fake" to "let me verify one claim"

**Status**: ⏳ Spec needed

---

### SECTION 3: VERIFY WITH YOUR OWN AI
**Purpose**: Ultimate skeptic hook - test in your territory, not ours  
**Key Elements**:
- Section title: "Verify With Your Own AI"
- Instructions: Open ChatGPT/Claude/Grok → Copy our prompts → Paste → See results
- Download Verification Pack button (preset prompts)
- No context from us, no vector store - pure independent test

**Why This Works**:
- Removes all trust requirements
- User tests with their own AI login
- Can't claim we rigged the results
- Converts die-hard skeptics

**Conversion Goal**: Prove it works independently, convert skeptics to believers

**Status**: ⏳ Spec needed

---

### SECTION 4: BOUNTIES
**Purpose**: Show practical application, invite contribution, signal credibility  
**Key Elements**:
- Section title: "Put It to Work—Win Real Money"
- Grid/list of bounties:
  - Clay Millennium Problems ($1M each)
  - ARC-AGI ($500K)
  - Harappan Script (academic recognition)
  - [Other major unsolved problems]
- Each bounty has:
  - Prize amount
  - "Get Started ↗" link (problem pack + starter code)
- CTAs: Browse Bounties, Submit Solution

**Why This Works**:
- Real money = serious credibility signal
- If TOE works, should solve these
- Converts believers into contributors
- Shows we're confident enough to invite challenge

**Conversion Goal**: Convert believers into active users/contributors

**Status**: ⏳ Spec needed

---

### SECTION 5: FALSIFY RECORD
**Purpose**: Show ongoing validation, invite adversarial testing  
**Key Elements**:
- Counter: "Attempts: 1,247 | Successful: 0"
- CTAs: View All Attempts, Submit Yours
- Links to public falsification attempts

**Why This Works**:
- Shows transparency (all attempts public)
- Builds credibility (0 successful falsifications)
- Invites challenge (not defensive)

**Conversion Goal**: Final credibility boost before impact sections

**Status**: ⏳ Spec needed

---

### SECTION 6: IMMEDIATE IMPACT
**Purpose**: Show what becomes possible now that walls are broken  
**Key Elements**:
- Section title: TBD (e.g., "What This Unlocks")
- Grid of immediate applications:
  - Climate/CO₂ capture
  - Aging/longevity
  - Superconductors/energy
  - Space travel
  - Robotics
  - Self-improving AI
- Each with brief description + "See how ↗"

**Why This Works**:
- Moves from theory to practical value
- Shows concrete next steps
- Appeals to builders/founders

**Conversion Goal**: Show real-world impact, convert to collaborators

**Status**: ⏳ To be designed

---

### SECTION 7: FUTURE PROGRESSION
**Purpose**: Paint vision from near-term to far future

  - Beyond (easter egg: Rick & Morty)
- Builds from sincere to playful

**Why This Works**:
- Stretches imagination
- Shows scope of implications
- Sincere until Kardashev, then playful
- Rewards engagement with easter egg

- Not theoretical only - real bounties, real money
- Not hiding limitations - honest about WIP engine

**What We Avoid**:
- Defensive marketing speak ("verified", "truth-tested")
- Academic jargon without clarity
- Overselling incomplete features
- Hiding behind credentials
- Fighting skepticism head-on (we invite it instead)
