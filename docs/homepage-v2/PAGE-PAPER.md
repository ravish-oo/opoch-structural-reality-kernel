## PAGE STRUCTURE

### HEADER
```
The Paper

The complete Theory of Everything—plain English first, 
then the full technical version.
```

---

### INTRO SECTION

```
## Two Versions

**Plain English** (below): The core ideas in everyday language. 
No math, no prerequisites. Start here.

**Full Technical Paper** (PDF): Complete mathematical framework, 
proofs, and derivations. For researchers.

Both say the same thing. Pick your starting point.

### Three Rules (Nothing Fancy)

**Truth:** Saying the same thing in different words doesn't make 
it "more true." Clean the statement once; cleaning it again 
shouldn't change it.

**Exact balance:** Every real change is powered by something. 
If you reduce uncertainty or lock in a fact, you pay (energy/time). 
No free lunch, no leftovers.

**Gluing:** When you join parts, their shared edge must match. 
Like puzzle pieces: if the edges disagree, the whole picture 
can't be right.

---

### Two Kinds of Change

**Free rearrangements:** Look different, mean the same. Costs 
nothing. (New wording, new viewpoint, camera angle, unit change.)

**Paid updates:** Real edits to what you know. They shrink 
uncertainty and cost energy/time. Each settled yes/no is a 
real, paid step.

---

### "Observer = Observed" (What It Really Means)

• Treat "you + world" as one system. Changing viewpoint is a 
  free rearrangement; it shouldn't create or remove facts.

• Only paid steps (measurements, commitments, decisions) move 
  the joint truth forward.

• Close any tiny loop "look → act → look": if it returns you 
  exactly to where you started (no wobble), your steps were 
  consistent. If there's a mismatch, you minted a difference 
  or left a debt.

---

### Speed of Understanding (Why Power Matters)

Learning has a fuel meter: locking in facts costs at least a 
tiny fixed amount per bit. With limited power, there's a hard 
cap on how fast your uncertainty can drop. More power → faster, 
guaranteed progress; less power → slower.

---

### Fixed-Point Gauge (FPG), in One Idea

Pick the viewpoint that removes unnecessary cross-talk between 
"you" and "world," so you can solve the whole thing in one pass. 
Think: rotate the knobs so each knob controls just one thing. 

Sometimes you can't kill all cross-talk; then you align to make 
it as small as possible. Either way, life gets simpler and faster.

---

### Pocket Checklist (Receipts You Can Actually Run)

✓ **Rephrase test:** Did a rewording change the meaning? If yes, 
  you minted a difference—fix it.

✓ **No-free-lunch test:** Did your certainty go up without 
  spending anything? Then something's off—find the hidden cost.

✓ **Seam test:** Do the parts agree on their shared boundary? 
  If not, don't trust the whole.

✓ **Loop test:** Do "observe → act → observe" loops come back 
  clean? If not, you've got wobble to remove.

✓ **Power→progress:** Are you learning at a rate your power 
  budget can actually support? If not, expectations are wrong.

---

That's the whole engine, simply: don't mint fake differences, 
pay exactly for real updates, make parts meet cleanly, and 
choose the viewpoint that cuts cross-talk. 

Then "observer is observed" isn't a slogan—it's how you move 
truth forward, at the exact speed your power allows.

### PDF HOSTING OPTIONS

**Option A: Self-hosted**
```
/paper.pdf on your domain
Link: https://opoch.com/paper.pdf
```
**Pros:** Full control  
**Cons:** Bandwidth costs, no version tracking

---

**Option B: arXiv**
```
If you publish to arXiv (recommended for academic credibility)
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX
```
**Pros:** Academic credibility, permanent hosting, version tracking  
**Cons:** Need to submit and get accepted

---

**Option C: GitHub**
```
Host on GitHub repo (public)
Link: https://github.com/opoch/toe-paper/blob/main/paper.pdf
```
**Pros:** Version control, free hosting, community can fork  
**Cons:** Less formal than arXiv

---

**Option D: Combination**
```
• PDF on your site: opoch.com/paper.pdf
• Also on arXiv: arxiv.org/abs/XXXX
• Also on GitHub: github.com/opoch/toe-paper

Link to all three on the page
```
**Pros:** Maximum accessibility, credibility, preservation  
**Cons:** Need to maintain multiple versions

**My recommendation: Option D (all three)**

# Plain English Content
Here’s the shortest, plain‑English version.
