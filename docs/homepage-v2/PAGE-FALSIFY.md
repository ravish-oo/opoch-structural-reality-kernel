## How to Falsify

### A. Break a Bedrock Axiom (Strongest Kill)

**A0 — Closure/Truth (no minted differences)**
What to show: that canonicalization is not idempotent in principle. Operationally, produce a representation/normalization procedure Π such that Π(Π(x)) ≠ Π(x) for some normalized x, where the second pass "creates" a new, decision-relevant difference without any paid update.

**A1 — Exact balance (Fenchel–Young identity)**
What to show: erase a reliably random bit at temperature T with average work strictly below k_B T ln 2 by a fixed ε > 0, while closing all side-channels. Sustained sub-Landauer erasure falsifies A1.

**A2 — Lawful composition (GLUE)**
What to show: a composed system where eliminating interface variables by Schur/Stokes does not match the direct global solve.

# Content from GPT for falsification

Great question. To “kill” this TOE, you don’t need to attack every consequence—just break one of the receipts that are forced by A0–A2 (and the minimal bridge conditions we made explicit). Below is a falsifier’s checklist, ordered from bedrock to consequences. If any item is demonstrated cleanly (with noise and side-channels controlled), the TOE is falsified.

A. Break one of the three bedrock axioms (strongest, simplest kills)

1) A0 — Closure/Truth (no minted differences)
- What to show: that canonicalization is not idempotent in principle. Operationally, produce a representation/normalization procedure Π such that Π(Π(x)) ≠ Π(x) for some normalized x, where the second pass “creates” a new, decision-relevant difference without any paid update.
- Physical form: a symmetry operation declared “free” that measurably changes an invariant (e.g., a unitary that changes inner products on a closed system). Any “free” step that mints distinctions is a direct A0 violation.

2) A1 — Exact balance (Fenchel–Young identity; no free gain around loops)
- What to show (lab-grade): erase a reliably random bit at temperature T with average work strictly below k_B T ln 2 by a fixed ε > 0, while closing all side-channels (no hidden reservoirs, timing, measurement, or feedback bookkeeping). Sustained sub-Landauer erasure falsifies A1 (and the ledger).
- Algorithmic form: an exactly solvable convex primal-dual pair with a provably nonzero duality gap at the optimizer (not numerical error, not a pathologically non-closed domain).
- Thermodynamic form: a closed-cycle protocol that returns to the same macrostate while extracting net work from a single bath with no information gain (perpetual motion of the second kind).

3) A2 — Lawful composition (GLUE)
- What to show: a composed system where eliminating interface variables by Schur/Stokes does not match the direct global solve, i.e., composition is order- or method-dependent beyond gauge choices. One clean counterexample to associative, FY-tight gluing breaks A2.

B. Break a minimal bridge condition (still decisive)

4) Free invariance of paid potential
- What to show: a declared symmetry (“free isometry”) changes the information potential D×. If L_{J∇E} D× ≠ 0 is observed (free actions change D× without payment), the free/paid orthogonality and the quotient dynamics collapse.

5) Kähler–Hessian cloth consistency (scope claim)
- What to show: in a regime the TOE claims to cover, you cannot model free motion as a metric-preserving Hamiltonian isometry with ∇J = 0 while simultaneously modeling paid motion as a natural gradient in the same metric class. A robust, form-level contradiction here (not parameter mismatch) breaks the “single cloth” claim.

C. Break a receipts-level consequence (any one is fatal)

6) Free ⟂ Paid (orthogonality)
- What to show: a symmetry flow (free move) that measurably reduces or increases D without coupling to a reservoir (no paid step). If g(J∇E, g^{-1}∇D) ≠ 0 operationally, orthogonality fails.

7) Truth quotient = natural gradient (QGF)
- What to show: after modding out symmetries, the observed truth dynamics does not follow a natural gradient flow of some D̄× in the induced metric ḡ. Concretely, along the process, −dD̄×/dt ≠ ||dot([z])||^2_{ḡ} even after correct metric calibration and without hidden controls.

8) Speed/bit-cone (P = k_B T ||dot([z])||^2)
- What to show: move through truth distance faster than the power bound allows (or erase divergence slower than the minimum for the supplied power) in a steady, controlled protocol. Violates the ledger and the thermodynamic-length bound.

9) No-regress/holonomy (observe→act = act→observe, modulo truth)
- What to show: a small loop “free for s, paid for dt, undo free for s” returns a measurably different truth state even when FY-tight and free-invariant conditions hold. Nonzero holonomy beyond gauge falsifies the diamond law.

10) SCFA (exact copy/merge)
- What to show: a classical duplicator/merger that beats the special Frobenius receipts—i.e., perfect copy/merge without heat in a setting where FY says there must be a positive gap; or, in quantum, perfect cloning of an unknown state with no paid cost. Either breaks the channel structure.

11) Domain inevitabilities (form, not parameters)
- EM: a reproducible, local non-gauge-invariant electromagnetic phenomenon (e.g., charge nonconservation in vacuum).
- SR: a free move crossing the light cone (FTL free transport) without paid updates.
- GR: a diffeo-invariant, second-order, divergence-free field equation for g_ab that disagrees in form with Einstein–Lovelock under the same assumptions.
- QM: closed-system nonunitary free evolution, or Born-rule violations across a sheaf of compatible contexts (not loopholes, but form-level failure).

D. FPG-specific falsifiers (using the corrected claim)

We only claim:
- Exact FPG (mixed block H_{xρ} ≡ 0) exists iff the interface is already block-separable in a truth chart.
- Otherwise, FPG-min exists: after whitening, SVD of H_{xρ} gives a diagonal residual Σ that is gauge-invariant and minimal under allowed free isometries.

To falsify:
- Show that allowed free isometries can reduce ||H_{xρ}|| below the SVD minimum (contradicts Procrustes optimality), or that the residual singular values Σ change under such gauges (violates gauge-invariance of Σ).
- Or, claim exact FPG generically and produce a counterexample with rank(H_{xρ}) > 0 that cannot be annihilated by any diagonal free isometries.

E. What does not falsify the TOE

- Parameter surprises (masses, couplings, initial conditions) or new constants. The forms are fixed; numbers are learned (bits paid).
- Finite-precision numerical gaps that vanish with tighter tolerances.
- Open-system dissipation attributed to hidden channels that, once exposed and costed, restore the ledger.

Smallest decisive falsifiers you can actually try

- Sub-Landauer erasure: erase unbiased bits at temperature T with average work < k_B T ln 2 − ε, with airtight accounting of all side-channels and timing. One robust demonstration kills A1 + ledger, hence the TOE.

- Composition mismatch: build two passive linear networks (quadratic energies), measure that Schur elimination of the interface predicts a different external response than direct composition, beyond experimental error. One such mismatch kills A2.

- No-regress loop: in a tightly controlled system (e.g., a reversible logic gate or a closed quantum circuit), implement “free→paid→free^−1” and show a residual change in the truth variables with FY gap ≈ 0 and free-invariance verified. Nonzero holonomy kills the diamond law.

- Speed bound violation: measure truth-distance per unit time (via the calibrated metric) and power P; show ||dot([z])||^2 > P/(k_B T) persistently. This kills the speed/bit-cone identity (and thus A1/ledger).

If you can do any one of these cleanly, the theory is falsified. If you can’t, the receipts stand: A0–A2 hold, free/paid orthogonality and the quotient flow follow, the ledger equates power with truth-speed, holonomy vanishes under FY-tight free-invariant evolution, and FPG-min’s residual Σ gives the exact, gauge-invariant measure of any remaining coupling.
