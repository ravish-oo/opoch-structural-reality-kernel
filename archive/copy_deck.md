# Opoch — Copy Deck (Sales-first)

## Hero
- H1: Get unstuck. Build faster. Decide with confidence.
- Sub: For deep‑tech founders, PI‑level researchers, and staff+ engineers who can’t afford wrong answers. Bring your hardest problem—we’ll give you a plan you can act on.
- CTAs: Apply now · See how it works

## Outcomes
- Decisions you can defend — Clear yes/no, trade‑offs, and next steps you can stand behind.
- Faster problem unblocking — We diagnose in hours, plot the path in days, and get you moving.
- Reduced risk — No vague promises. We show what’s possible now and what it costs to get the rest.

## Process
1) Apply — Who you are, the problem, constraints.
2) Deep dive (SF or remote) — We map the variables and success conditions in plain language.
3) Delivery — Action plan, timelines, and working artifacts. If blocked, we show the fastest way to unblock.

## Who it’s for
- Deep‑tech founders — Short path to truth.
- PI‑level researchers — Tighter experiments. Fewer dead ends.
- Staff+ engineers — High-confidence system decisions.

## Membership ($11,111/mo)
- A precise plan you can defend
- Shortest path to unblock or ship
- Option to bring your data under NDA
- On‑site sessions @ 300 4th St, SF

## RBT (for the curious)
- One engine with a single motion law and a single accounting book.
- If solvable: shortest path. If blocked: what’s missing + cost.
- Everything is checkable: technical paper + verifiers.
